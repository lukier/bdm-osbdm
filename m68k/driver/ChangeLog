        * bdm.h: New version for the CF long reset.

        Removed setting the DSI signal to 0 on each bit.
        Added support to detect false halt conditions by attempting
        to read the PC twice. If you can the target has halted.
        The cache is invalidated only if it is enabled.
        Debug trace clean ups.

2000-03-30  Chris Johns  <ccj@acm.org>

1999-05-25  source  <ccj@acm.org>

        * Makefile:
        It seems that depmod complains about unresolved symbols even
        when the driver loads and works properly.  I don't know what's
        changed in Linux to cause this, but for now just get rid of
        the depmod.
	
1999-03-18  Chris Johns  <ccj@acm.org>

        * bdm.c: Add support for 2.2.xx kernels.

	a change of state from running to stopped, or when go or step commands
	are issued.

Sat Jan  9 03:04:03 1999  Chris Johns  <ccj@acm.org>

	* bdm.c: Remove the `sti()' calls in the `bdm_sleep' function.

	always being returned from the BDM module.

Wed Oct 14 14:32:04 1998  Chris Johns  <ccj@acm.org>

	* bdm.c: Mask pending interrupts in single-step mode.
	Fixed the status handling. It now uses the csr register. It is cached
	to handle the fact the status bits are set for only one read.

Wed Oct 14 10:55:33 1998  Chris Johns  <ccj@acm.org>

	* bdm.c:
	Added support for the Coldfire BDM and P&E interface. This has only

	* bdm.c: Don't release ports that have been stolen from another driver.

	* bdm.c:
	Install driver even if I/O ports are claimed by some other driver.
	I don't really like doing this, but the alternative would be to
	require that the parallel port (LP) driver be unloaded before
	the BDM driver could be loaded.

	* bdm.c: More init_module message cleanup.

	* bdm.c: Fix up init_module message.

	* Makefile, bdm.c, bdm.h: Initial revision
