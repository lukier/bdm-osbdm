How to use the SCO BDM driver
-----------------------------

1.	Type "make" to build the driver.  I have only tested it when compiled
	with the SCO compiler.  It does compile with "gcc",  so you may be in
	luck if thats the path taht you follow.

2.	Edit "System" and set the entry that corresponds to your parallel port
	to 'Y'.

3.	Login as root and type "make install".  This will put the driver into
	the kernel.

4.	Re-build the kernel by running "/etc/conf/bin/idbuild -y" as root,  and
	the reboot to activate the driver.

5.	Build yourself a GDB with BDM support (documented somewhere else :-)

6.	Run gdb on the executable you want to debug.  At the prompt turn on BDM
	with "target bdm /dev/XXXX".  The driver automatically installs all the
	possible devices in /dev:

		/dev/bdmcp0 - CPU32 on LP0
		/dev/bdmcp1 - CPU32 on LP1
		/dev/bdmcp2 - CPU32 on LP2
		/dev/bdmcp3 - CPU32 on LP3
		/dev/bdmcf0 - Coldfire on LP0
		/dev/bdmcf1 - Coldfire on LP1
		/dev/bdmcf2 - Coldfire on LP2
		/dev/bdmcf3 - Coldfire on LP3

7.	Happy debugging.

Compiling the rest of the tree
------------------------------

1.	The Makfile in the lib directory needs the ranlib removed and some
	other options like -Wall taken out for the SCO compiler.

2.	The Makefile in the test directory needs the "-lbfd -liberty" taken
	out.

3.	If you do want to use parts of the library that require the BFD library
	then you will have to work through that on your own :-)
