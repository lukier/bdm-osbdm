	* linux-bdm.c: Still need the config modules check.

	* Makefile: Do not force module versions on. Detect it now.

	* linux-bdm.c:
	Use config.h (autoconfig.h) to detect if module version numbers are
	enabled. On RH7.0 you still get warnings.

        structure changes.

        * Makefile:
        It seems that depmod complains about unresolved symbols even
        when the driver loads and works properly.  I don't know what's
        changed in Linux to cause this, but for now just get rid of
        the depmod.
