 The BDM driver is built as a FreeBSD kernel module. Not as a driver that
 can be linked into the kernel. The BDM kernel module is loaded and unloaded
 at runtime, with the bdm and unbdm scripts.

 The BDM kernel module is built as part of the FreeBSD kernel sources. The
 /usr/src/sys sources distribution needs to be installed before the BDM
 kernel module can be built. The Makefile assumes the kernel sources are
 installed at /usr/src/sys.

 The device special files need to be created as root, with
 ../../local_scripts/MAKEDEV.

 The BDM kernel module has been built and tested with FreeBSD 4.0, the
 Coldfire processor and P&E Coldfire interface.

 To build:

     $ make

 To install (as root):

     # make install
     #  ../../local_scripts/MAKEDEV

 To load BDM kernel module:

     $ /usr/bin/bdm

 To unload BDM kernel module:

     $ /usr/bin/unbdm
