BUGS 
==== 

1) Dell Pentium III machines seem to not work. Not really sure why but clearing
the parallel port register for the CF processors causes the parallel port to
either initialise or reset and not work.

2) Coldfire - support to detect version of the debug module for auto detection
of the PST lines has problems if a BDM pod is not connected to the target or
the target is not powered.

3) The 5407 BDM hardware does not implement the SSI bit and the driver tries to
use it. No idea why this bit was removed as it was just stupid. The work
arounds for the driver are complex and not yet implemented.

3) For m68k ELF systems you need to be careful about the binutils mix you
use. Binutils of versions 2.9.5.* will not work with gdb-4.18 or earilier. You
will get core dumps. Earilier version of gcc and binutils as used by the uLinux
project have some problems.

It is a good idea to turn on the debug and look at the output. Keep
the log as it might be useful for us to track the problem down.

A patch is also welcome.
