BUGS 
==== 

- Missing 5282 support (patch needed).

- Duplicated debug output on windows.

- PCI parallel ports with non-standard port-addresses not supported.

- Probing of different access methods (driver, ioperm, bdmd) with
  irritating error messages.
  This one and the PCI parallel ports above would probably best be resolved
  by a new naming sheme for the target devices.

- In insight-5.3, when "Run" button is hit, no bdm_reset is executed. This
  leads to the effect that _first_ "Run" works (since you can/should put
  bdm_reset into the setup-and-load macro). But the _second_ "Run" will
  fail since IRQs are left enabled and some registers are writeable only
  once after reset.

- Insight-6.0 don't work at all.

- The target is hardwired to /dev/bdmcf0 in insight.

- Parallel port on Elitegroup ECS K7S5A (sis735 chipset) motherboard seems not
  to work. The port pins are active only for a couple milliseconds after an
  edge of the strobe signal and set tri-state thereafter. The bdm adaptor
  requires that the pins have valid signals all the time. Tri-stating the pins
  result in loss of control over the adaptor/target.

- Dell Pentium III machines seem to not work. Not really sure why but clearing
  the parallel port register for the CF processors causes the parallel port to
  either initialise or reset and not work.

- Coldfire - support to detect version of the debug module for auto detection
  of the PST lines has problems if a BDM pod is not connected to the target or
  the target is not powered.

- The 5407 BDM hardware does not implement the SSI bit and the driver tries to
  use it. No idea why this bit was removed as it was just stupid. The work
  arounds for the driver are complex and not yet implemented.

- For m68k ELF systems you need to be careful about the binutils mix you use.
  Binutils of versions 2.9.5.* will not work with gdb-4.18 or earilier. You
  will get core dumps. Earilier version of gcc and binutils as used by the
  ucLinux project have some problems.

Reporting Them:

If you've got any questions/remarks about any of this, please contact the BDM
project mailing list on the SourceForge web site:

It is a good idea to turn on the debug and look at the output. Keep
the log as it might be useful for us to track the problem down.

A patch is also welcome.
