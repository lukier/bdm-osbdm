cpu32-check - a program to exercise the gdb-bdm driver and your CPU32 
(mc68360) based target system.

DESCRIPTION:
cpu32-check is a derivative of the program 'chk' written by Chris Johns to 
test both CPU32 and Coldfire targets. cpu32-check provides tests that can
help verify that both the BDM driver and the target are working properly.

BACKGROUND:
I found myself in a situation in which I had both an unknown/untested BDM 
driver and an untested custom CPU32 (mc68360) based target system.

I wrote cpu32-check to help.  I considered augmenting 'chk' to more fully 
support the CPU32, but I was in a hurry and did not really have the time to 
do a proper job of integrating the CPU32 target stuff I needed into 'chk'.  
cpu32-check is the result.

STATUS:
cpu32-check is very much a work in progress.  I stopped working on it when 
my target started to work with the P&E BDM driver. It's a little rough around
the edges, but the program was very useful to for performing hardware
verification test on my target system and for confirming that the BDM driver
was functioning properly.

At this point, the only things that don't seem to work are the functions that
deal with the mc68360's internal memory: the internal memory test and executing
a program from internal memory.  The fixes are probably pretty simple.

The functions that deal with external memory seem to work fine.

I hope that someone can take a look at the program and make improvements and
additions, or merge some of the functionality provided in 'cpu32-check' into
the 'chk' program.

TO DO:
1. Look at merging useful functions into 'chk'
2. Fix code execution from internal RAM
3. Fix internal RAM test
4. Look at pulling target-specific initializations out of the main program.
   Perhaps some kind of external configuration file (or command language?)
5. Make it easier to use cpu32-check to do 'punishment tests' i.e. run
   the driver and target in a loop for several hours and either stop on
   errors or otherwise record them.

The portions of this cpu32-chk that I wrote may be freely used for any purpose.
I ask only that any improvements, enhancements, fixes, etc... be submitted for
inclusion in the distribution so that others may benefit from them and that 
the author information in the sources be left intact.
